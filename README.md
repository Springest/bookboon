# Bookboon

This gem is a simple API wrapper for the [Bookboon API](https://github.com/bookboon/api).
> Bookboon.com is the worldâ€™s largest publisher of online educational literature. We provide free textbooks for university students, premium eBooks for business professionals and learning solutions for companies.

For access to the API please consult Bookboon directly.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bookboon'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bookboon

## Usage

### Set up

```ruby
client = Bookboon::Client.new do |config|
  config.id = "..."
  config.secret = "..."
end
```

Additional config settings are available:

```ruby
config.language = "..." # Defaults to "en", see Bookboon API reference for available languages
config.branding_id = "..." # Defaults to nil
config.rotation_id = "..." # Defaults to nil
```

### Available methods

Please refer to the official [Bookboon API Reference](https://github.com/bookboon/api/blob/master/Reference.md) for structure of the output. Right now no transformation of any kind is done, we just return the raw output from Bookboon as a Hash, except for the `download_book` method, which returns a temporary URL to download the book directly.

* `client.categories`
* `client.category(id)`
* `client.search(term)`
* `client.book(id)`
* `client.download_book(id, handle)`
